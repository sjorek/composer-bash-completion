# Contributing to this project

## Contributor Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Workflow

* Fork the project.
* Make your bug fix or feature addition.
* Add tests for it. This is important, so your changes don't break
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Please make sure that you have [set up your user name and email address](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>`
look really stupid in the commit history of a project.

Pull requests for bug fixes must be based on latest tag whereas pull
requests for new features must be based on the `master` branch.

Trying to keep backwards compatibility breaks to an absolute minimum is
the goal. Please take this into account when proposing changes.

Due to time constraints, responses won't come as quickly as we would
like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to send reminders
if you feel that you have been forgotten.
